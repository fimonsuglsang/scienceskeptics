Code for the article "Is science skepticism really about science?"

To reproduce the analyses from the article, follow these steps:

1) download the data from the webpage linked in the data folder
2) run scripts "scripts/1_clean.r", "scripts/2_reg.r", and "scripts/3_pred.r". This cleans the data produces regressions and predictions. (a bit time comsuming, but saves regressions)
3) run "scripts/4_main.r" to reproduce all figures.
4) the additional analyses in the suplemental materials are reproduces running "scripts/5_addnalysis.r"

All scripts are anotated to indicate the steps taken. Contact me at simon.fuglsang@ps.au.dk in case of any questions.
